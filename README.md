Hi guys!! I'm trying something new and as in the title I'm starting to play with The Angular Framework.

What I have learned so far:
- Angular execution contex
- data binding: 
  - property binding 
  - event binding
  - two-way-binding 
  - string interpolation
- structural and attribute directives
- components 
  - creating new ones
  - addition
  - importing
  - styling
  
  My thoughts... The "Component" concept is GREAT! Everything is clear and seems to be in the right place.
